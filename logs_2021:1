1. if df has missing data, how to improve the current pipeline?
- already tried simpleimputer, seems still error.

2. in pipeline, labelencoder() cant go like onehotencoder(), ordinalencoder()
- labelencoder need x only while the ther two needs x,y?
- when to use labelencoder? basde on the number of cat_Var?

3. after cat_var num_var drop 'id', then pipeline, how to add 'id' gracefully back
and split into train/test splits?
